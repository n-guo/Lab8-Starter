### Graceful Degradation and Service Workers:
Service workers are used to help apps be resilient to a lack of internet connection. Service workers are able to store data from an initial request directly on the computer, meaning even without an internect connection the previous response can be fetched. It basically can serve as a backup in the event of missing internet connection. This represents one process by which graceful degradation can be implemented, as graceful degradation is ensuring lower levels of technology (i.e. no internet access) can still be handled smoothly. Service workers allow software to function even without maximum technology available.
